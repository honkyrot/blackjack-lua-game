# blackjack-lua-game
Created with Lua 5.4.2
(Singleplayer) Blackjack game but in Lua.
Uses metaclasses and OOP.

Just a fun little project I did in my free time for Lua programming.
Use this however you want.

The game has its own rules.
The dealer won't hit until you stand.
You can continue hitting after a hit.
There are soft and hard aces.
There is NO splitting or doubling.
